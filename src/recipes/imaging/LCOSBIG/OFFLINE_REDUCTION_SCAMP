OFFLINE_REDUCTION_SCAMP - Reduce a normal imaging EXPOSE observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It performs a debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, flat-field
division, automatic astrometry (using SCAMP), object detection and catalogue 
creation and converts to a PNG graphic and FITS version of the reduced frame.
See the "Notes" for further information.
